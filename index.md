## Jeff Fossi Portfolio

I am currently completing my Master's in Data Science. This is a highlight of my recent projects. 

# [Project 1: Covid Tracker SQL](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/ec77c8421874d845763fef7e1b27707e476ab35d/Covid%20Query.sql)
* Created a tool to track current covid data.
* Engineered features
* Built a client facing API using Tableau.

# [Project 2: Anova in R](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/3c5afc88f36b0f6288d802280f4f14c7b0d27992/Project%202%20Anova)
* generated sample data.
* Reviewed one-way and two-way Anova in R.
* Generate, compare and review plots.

# [Project 3: An R refresher](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/3c5afc88f36b0f6288d802280f4f14c7b0d27992/Project%203%20R%20basics)
* I needed a refresh on R basics after a year of not using it much.

# [Project 4: Titanic Python](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/817b7869ef8987db48a3a31df8bac998c144b0ca/Titanic%20Data%20set%20Python)
* Here I analyze the Titanic dataset to output predictions of survivial.
* Explored the data using visualization.
* Performed data cleansing.
* Performed outlier analysis.
* Train Test split data and train model using SVC.
* Obtained predictions from the model and create a confusion matrix and a classification report.
* Engineered features using PCA.
* Exported prediction results to .csv file. 

#[Project 5: Union Membership](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/d928e29e55872e561dcc138e8035956716eda1b0/Union%20Python)
* This was one of my proudest models thus far.
* This was for a competition in which I had the top score of 83%
* This was done by performing extensive PCA and ensemble to optimize results.
* Linear Regression
* Optimized Linear Regression, Extra Tree Classifier, XG Boost, Cat Boost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, naive Bayes, SVC, Decision Tree and KNN to find the best model. Well in this case, to obtain the best score :)
* Predicted members likely to leave a union.
