## Jeff Fossi Portfolio

I am currently completing my Master's in Data Science. This is a highlight of my recent projects. 

# [Project 1: Covid Tracker SQL](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/ec77c8421874d845763fef7e1b27707e476ab35d/Covid%20Query.sql)
* Created a tool to track current covid data.
* Engineered features
* Built a client facing API using Tableau.

# [Project 2: Anova in R](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/3c5afc88f36b0f6288d802280f4f14c7b0d27992/Project%202%20Anova)
* generated sample data.
* Reviewed one-way and two-way Anova in R.
* Generate, compare and review plots.

# [Project 3: An R refresher](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/3c5afc88f36b0f6288d802280f4f14c7b0d27992/Project%203%20R%20basics)
* I needed a refresh on R basics after a year of not using it much.

# [Project 4: Titanic Python](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/817b7869ef8987db48a3a31df8bac998c144b0ca/Titanic%20Data%20set%20Python)
* Here I analyze the Titanic dataset to output predictions of survivial.
* Explored the data using visualization.
* Performed data cleansing.
* Performed outlier analysis.
* Train Test split data and train model using SVC.
* Obtained predictions from the model and create a confusion matrix and a classification report.
* Engineered features using PCA.
* Exported prediction results to .csv file. 

# [Project 5: Union Membership Python(Jupyter)](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/d928e29e55872e561dcc138e8035956716eda1b0/Union%20Python)
* This was one of my proudest models thus far.
* This was for a competition in which I had the top score of 83%
* This was done by performing extensive PCA and ensemble to optimize results.
* Linear Regression
* Optimized Linear Regression, Extra Tree Classifier, XG Boost, Cat Boost, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, naive Bayes, SVC, Decision Tree and KNN to find the best model. Well in this case, to obtain the best score :)
* Predicted members likely to leave a union.

# [Project 6: Amazon Book Sales (R)](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/90ed47e3dfbbadd335f2880f98b3c461b0bcd791/Amazon%20books%20Visualization)
* Web scraped the dataset from the Amazon website base on top selling books between 2013 and 2022.
* Data was collected August 22, 2022
* Analysis performed included looking at the various book formats, most popular authors during the period, the most popular book titles, and best books by user rating.
* Features visualizaions for the topics above. 

# [Project 7: Battery Life Experimental Design](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/90ed47e3dfbbadd335f2880f98b3c461b0bcd791/Experimental%20Design%20Battery%20life.Rmd)
* Experiment was designed and conducted to study life (in hours) of two different brands of batteries.
* A completely randomized two-factor factorial experiment was conducted.

# [Project 8: Data Visualization Bokeh Python](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/90ed47e3dfbbadd335f2880f98b3c461b0bcd791/Week%205_Bokeh%20Example_Fossi_Jeff.ipynb)
* My interpretation of Gapminder’s “The Health and Wealth of Nations”

# [Project 9: Three Way Anova Experimental design in R](https://github.com/jmfoss03/FossiPortfolio/blob/90ed47e3dfbbadd335f2880f98b3c461b0bcd791/Week5_Three%20Way%20ANOVA.Rmd)
* A researcher wanted to know how water temperature, water salinity, and density of shrimp populations influenced the growth rate of shrimp raised in aquaria and whether the factors acted independently on the shrimp populations.
